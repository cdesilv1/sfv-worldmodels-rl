# sfv-worldmodels-rl

This project was started as a way to implement the reinforcement learning algorithm explored in this paper, which was presented at NIPS 2018:
<https://worldmodels.github.io/>


The `.mcr` file was created via the Macro Recorder by Jitbit, and is intended to be used in conjunction with the random actions bot to generate the sample data used for training using simple image recognition to solve the problem of a menu prompt that occurs at the completion of every game which requires user input.

More documentation to come as this project is fleshed out.
